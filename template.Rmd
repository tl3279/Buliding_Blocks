I'm an R Markdown document!

# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from a *normal distribution*:

```{r eval = FALSE}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too! The mean is `r mean(samp)`.

# Learning assessment

This is code for the learning assessment P8105

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

la_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(500, mean = 1),
  samp_g0 = norm_samp > 0,
  abs_v_samp = abs(norm_samp)
)

ggplot(la_df, aes(x = abs_v_samp)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```
